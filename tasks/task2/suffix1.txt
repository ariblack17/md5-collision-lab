I'm under surface
Towers veiled in silk
I guess I'm not welcome in this house they built
Under surface
Towering; veiled in silk
I know I'm not welcome in this house
A naked soul blissfully dancing in the wind
Immersing in ecstasy
No wondering
A sense my body finds
Feelings and thoughts align
Enough to find
A sense, our bodies' crime
Colours swirl
Tonight, I walk in rhythm
A shift in me
Soon you'll see
Our colours swirl in rhythm
We're found
Blissfully dancing
Pull together
Flowing through us now
Moving forward
Oh, somehow
Colours swirl
Tonight, I walk in rhythm
A shift in me
Soon you'll see
Our colours swirl in rhythm
You're found in pieces
Towers veiled in silk will crumble by my hand
All I've loved I've lost
In due time you'll be the sacrifice
Sacrifice
By my hand Sacrifice In the house they built
