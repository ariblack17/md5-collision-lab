WOULDYOUWAITFORME?
Doomed savior, true maker
Hunt me down 'til dusk
Would you wait for me there?
Mix the sugar with the blood
Take the top off and you'll blow
Push the knife against your throat
What's inside you? I wanna know
Did you stay just to watch me suffer?
I wanna know
Should l swallow the pain to touch her?
Just another
Doomed savior, true maker
Hunt me down 'til dusk
Would you wait for me and
Choose death or lose everything?
Strangling your love
Would you wait for me there?
I'll hide inside your conscious
Like poison left in me
Does the pleasure hold you over
While you're feeding from my apathy?
Twist the knife
You make it so hard to breathe
Black my eyes
You keep your secrets from me
Falsify, drying, digitize
Crucify
I'll take your sick disease
Did you stay just to watch me suffer?
I wanna know
Were you shaking with disappointment?
Overdosing on your fucking lies
Doomed savior, true maker
Hunt me down 'til dusk
Would you wait for me and
Choose death or lose everything?
Strangling your love
Would you wait for me there?
